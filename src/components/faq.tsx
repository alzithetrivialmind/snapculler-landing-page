    {
        question: "Is SnapCuller free?",
        answer: "Yes! SnapCuller has a generous free tier for standard photos. You can view, Pan/Zoom, and sort JPG/PNG files instantly. The Pro version unlocks professional RAW support, unlimited workflow presets, advanced EXIF filtering, and seamless Lightroom integration."
    },
    {
        question: "What camera formats are supported?",
        answer: "SnapCuller Pro supports professional RAW formats from all major manufacturers, including Sony (ARW), Canon (CR2/CR3), Nikon (NEF), Fujifilm (RAF), and more. It also handles iPhone HEIC files perfectly."
    },
    {
        question: "Does it work offline?",
        answer: "Absolutely. SnapCuller is a desktop-native app that runs 100% on your machine. Your photos never leave your device, and you don't need an internet connection to cull your shoots with lightning speed."
    },
    {
        question: "How does it sync with Lightroom?",
        answer: "SnapCuller uses industry-standard sidecar files. When you rate or label a photo, it creates a small metadata file that Adobe Lightroom and Capture One read automatically. Your sorting work is preserved perfectly."
    },
    {
        question: "What platforms are supported?",
        answer: "SnapCuller is currently optimized for Windows 10 and 11. We are working hard to bring this same speed to macOS and other platforms very soon."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from existing tools?",
        answer: "Most tools are bloated with editing features that slow down the initial selection process. SnapCuller is built with one goal: Speed. It's about muscle memory, zero import lag, and getting your best shots found in record time."
